After I graduated, I moved to Marietta to attend Kennesaw State University. Currently, I am a Computer Engineering student and I intend to graduate Fall 2021. I fell in love with this field my first semester of college and have not stopped working hard since then. My Freshman year, I helped form a professional club at KSU called the Computer Engineering Apprentices(link) to get more students involved in school and expand their interests in Engineering, now it is my Junior year and I have become President of this club and already have made so many plans for the upcoming school year!
