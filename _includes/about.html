              <br>
                <p> After I graduated I moved to Marieta to attend Kennesaw State University and study Computer Engineering and I will be graduating Fall 2021. I fell in love with this field my first semester of college and have not stopped since then. I helped form a professional club at KSU called the Computer Engineering Apprentices to get more students involved in school and expand their interests in Engineering. </p>
