              <br>
                <p>I went to Peachtree Ridge High School in Suwannee where I joing and eventually became an officer in a popular club called the Technology Student Association and competed every year. My greatest achievemnt was placing 3rd in Georiga for fashion design, you can see my winning dress here! After I graduated I moved to Marieta to attend Kennesaw State University and study Computer Engineering and I will be graduating Fall 2021. I fell in love with this field my first semester of college and have not stopped since then. I helped form a professional club at KSU called the Computer Engineering Apprentices to get more students involved in school and expand their interests in Engineering. </p>
